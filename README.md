## Advanced Lane Finding

<img src="output_images/Lines detected.jpg" width="240" alt="Combined Image" />


Overview:
---
Project #4 from the Udacity Self-Driving Car program (SDC).
In this code we make use of advanced image processing techniques to detect lines on the road. By using a combination of camera calibrations, gradients in different color spectrus (ie. rgb vs hsv) and histograms, we can identifiy lane on the road with a high degree of accuracy.

Tools and Techniques:
---
* Code built on Python.
* OpenCV
* Histogram and image warping techniques

Conclusions:
---
Combining different advanced image processing techniques provide a gamma of possibilities..

Although the code is more complex (compared to project #1), the results are much more robust and can be applied in different scenarios (ie. bad weather or visibility conditions) with good results.
